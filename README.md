# 🍱 Food Delivery App – Home Page UI (Figma)

This project is a practice design of a Food Delivery App home screen created using Figma.
My main focus in this design was to learn and implement scroll interactions properly.


## 🎯 What I Practiced

- Created food category cards and then converted them into frames
- Used Auto Layout to maintain proper spacing and alignment
- Applied Clip Content to enable scrolling inside elements
  
## Implemented both:
- 💡Horizontal Scroll for food category cards
- 💡Vertical Scroll for the complete page flow

Designed with the goal of making content easy to explore for users

## 🛠️ Tools Used

🎨Figma - (Auto Layout, Constraints, Clip Content, Scroll Interactions)
